### TODO List
1. Fix the accented character got from the stimuli file.
2. Divide the Argument column in three columns (arguent-p1, arguemnt-p2, argument-c)
3. Update the experiment setting adding the following fields: Sex, Age, ...

### Issues fixed
1. ####conditionsFile
To generate a proper "condition file" you need to use excel and save the file in the following formats "xslx" or "cvs".
If you use another text editor it will not work.

2. ####Unicode HOWTO
If you need to set an accented character you should generate the unicode string of length 1 that contains the corresponding code point.
For example by using the python console you should type the following command:
```
>>> u'Ã¨'
u'\xe8'
```
